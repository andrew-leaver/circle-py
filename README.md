# circle-py

This requires John Zelle's graphics.py
See https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py

This is a simple example that writes a line of text, draws a circle,
waits for a mouse click and then moves the circle;
waits for one more mouse click and then moves it some more,
before finally waiting for a click to exit
